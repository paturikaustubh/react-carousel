# React Carouel 🎞️

Tried to build a unique image carousel in React. The main aspect that separates this from most of the other carousels are the navigation buttons.

Experience it [here](https://paturikaustubh.github.io/react-carousel/)! ⚡

This feature can be experienced on larger screens only!🖥️

## What is a carousel?
Not a merry-go-round 🎠 that you find in amusement parks, but it's a slideshow that cycles thrugh a series of images, generally used to show multiple images/content in a single screen/section. And kinda also helps in making the website look cool 😎.
